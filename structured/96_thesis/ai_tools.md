## Top AI Tools for Finding AI Papers

- **Semantic Scholar**
    
    An AI-powered research engine that offers advanced search, automated summaries, citation tracking by influence, and paper discovery based on relevance and similarity. Particularly useful for finding new and influential papers in AI and computer science fields.
    
- **Connected Papers**
    
    Visualizes how papers are related within a research field, making it easy to explore citation networks, find prior/derivative work, and identify research directions. Great for mapping the landscape of a specific AI topic.
    
- **Elicit**
    
    Uses large language models to automate literature reviews, suggest relevant papers by topic or question, and extract/summarize information from multiple papers. Very helpful for rapidly compiling a survey of a subfield.
    
- **Consensus**
    
    Focuses on finding concise scholarly answers to research questions based on the findings and claims from papers. Especially good for quick fact-checking and getting evidence-based answers.
    
- **Research Rabbit**
    
    Enables visual exploration of research networks connected by citations and co-authorship, helping users find overlooked papers and new directions. It’s like “Spotify for academic literature."
    
- **Papers With Code**
    
    Designed for AI research, this platform connects academic papers with their code implementations, useful for those looking for reproducible research in AI and machine learning.
    
- **Arxiv Sanity Lite**
    
    A practical interface for tracking trending and new AI papers on arXiv, with features like filtering, bookmarking, and personalized feeds.
    
- **SciSpace (formerly Typeset/SciSpace GPT)**
    
    Lets users search, read, and converse with research papers. It also provides summaries, identifies gaps, and generates new research ideas.
    
- **Perplexity AI**
    
    An LLM-powered search engine that answers research queries with cited sources, offering quick access to relevant papers and summaries.
    
- **Scite**
    
    Classifies and displays citation context (supporting or contrasting), letting you assess the impact and reliability of a given AI paper at a glance.

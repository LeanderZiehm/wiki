Absolutely. If you’re interested in **structured note-taking and organization methods** similar to the PARA method, here’s a detailed overview of prominent systems:

---

### 1. **PARA Method (Tiago Forte)**

* **Purpose:** Organize digital files and notes by actionability and project relevance.
* **Structure:** Four categories:

  1. **Projects** – short-term, active tasks with outcomes
  2. **Areas** – ongoing responsibilities (e.g., health, finances, server maintenance)
  3. **Resources** – reference material or knowledge for later use
  4. **Archives** – inactive items or completed projects
* **Use case:** Digital file organization, notes, code snippets, documentation. Works well on VPS projects, Docker setups, and personal knowledge management.

---

### 2. **Zettelkasten**

* **Purpose:** Build a web of interlinked notes for knowledge development.
* **Structure:**

  * **Atomic notes** (one idea per note)
  * **Permanent notes** (well-formed, reusable)
  * **Literature notes** (notes from reading/research)
* **Use case:** Research, long-term knowledge building, interconnected learning.

---

### 3. **GTD (Getting Things Done)**

* **Purpose:** Organize tasks and projects efficiently.
* **Structure:**

  * **Capture** – collect all tasks and ideas
  * **Clarify** – define next actions
  * **Organize** – sort into projects, contexts, or priorities
  * **Reflect** – review periodically
  * **Engage** – do the tasks
* **Use case:** Task management, project workflow, personal productivity.

### 4. **Digital Garden**

* **Purpose:** Public or private note system emphasizing growth and connectivity over time.
* **Structure:** Notes are **interlinked** like a web rather than linear folders.
* **Use case:** Long-term idea cultivation, documentation, tutorials, technical notes.

---

### 5. **Evergreen Notes**

* **Purpose:** Maintain durable, reusable knowledge.
* **Structure:**

  * Notes are **atomic**
  * **Linked** to other notes when relevant
  * Updated continuously
* **Use case:** Developers, researchers, content creators. Works well with Zettelkasten or Digital Garden systems.

---

### 6. **Cornell / PARA-Inspired Notes**

* **Purpose:** Optimize study notes for recall.
* **Structure:**

  * **Cue column** (keywords/questions)
  * **Notes column** (main content)
  * **Summary section** (short recap)
* **Use case:** Learning, documentation, or structured project notes.

---

### Summary

* **Action-Oriented:** PARA, GTD
* **Knowledge-Oriented:** Zettelkasten, Evergreen Notes, Digital Garden
* **Learning-Oriented:** Cornell Notes

For someone managing VPS projects, Docker setups, and documentation, **a hybrid PARA + Zettelkasten approach works well**: PARA organizes files and projects, Zettelkasten organizes technical knowledge, notes, and troubleshooting tips.

If you want, I can draft a **practical folder/note structure combining PARA and Zettelkasten for self-hosting projects**, so you could apply it directly to your VPS.

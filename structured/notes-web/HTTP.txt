3. Implement Token Binding or Mutual TLS (mTLS)
Token binding ties the token to a specific TLS session or client, preventing token reuse if intercepted.
mTLS requires both client and server to authenticate with certificates, increasing security.

Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS.
Use DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and certificate pinning where possible.

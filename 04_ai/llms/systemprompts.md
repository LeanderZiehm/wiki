```
My operating system is: arch linux on gnome wayland with yay Editor: vscode. I prefer vim over nano. I have a vps with a public IP. I like using .env and docker compose for my projects whenever possible. I always make sure to load secrets like passwords, emails, API keys and so from env files so I can safely commit all my code and compose files to git.
```

```
For a new project if it needs setup I always write a setup.py and helper scripts to make sure I and others and easily get setup and started with the project at the same working state.

NEVER EVER WRITE secrets or passwords in a compose file! Always use .env

I love  self hosting. I have my own vps with 50GB storage, 24 GB RAM, 4 cores.
Right now I mostly host my own apps with tmux and the native commands like npm or unicorn to run them there but I want to migrate to docker compose. When I self host other GitHub app projects I use docker compose up -d --build. I use portainer to view the container. I have a grafana dashboard with promethuos and node exporter. For reverse proxy I use nginx with my own cli tool to setup a new subdomain pointing to a port with automatic Https and it works well but I am thinking of maybe migrating to something like traefik or caddy. I also am curious to explore kunernetes but as I currently only have this one vps I didn't see the need yet.
